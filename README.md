# Artificial-Intelligence-Algorithms

  Python Code for some of the  **AI problems**.

## Python Version

The code is in **Python 3.7**. It should also run in later versions, but does not run in Python 2. You can install Python or use a browser-based Python interpreter such as repl.it. You can run the code in an IDE, or from the command line with python -i filename.py where the -i option puts you in an interactive loop where you can run Python functions. All notebooks are available in a binder environment. Alternatively, visit jupyter.org for instructions on setting up your own Jupyter notebook environment.
